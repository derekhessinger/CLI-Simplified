    <h2>What is the Command Line? </h2>

    <p>The command line (or terminal - they're essentially the same thing), is a text interface to used to interact and run programs on your computer.
      This website will introduce you to the basics of command line interface (CLI) tools and how to use them effectively. </p>

    <h2> What does it do? </h2>

    <p>Most people are familiar with interacting with a computer through a graphical user interface (those buttons you click to run programs).
      The command line provides an alternative to this, allowing you to run programs and a large number of tools straight from a terminal! 
      <br><br>
      As a new programmer, you'll undoubtedly run into programs that require you to run commands from the terminal. 
      Even if you don't, some people find it much faster to do everything via a command line and bypass the use of a mouse entirely.  </p>

    <h2> Let's Get Started! </h2>

    <h3> Accessing the Command Line</h3>

    <h4> On MacOS/Linux/Unix</h4>

    <p>A terminal will be available by default as an application.</p>

    <h4> On Windows</h4>

    <p>It's a tiny bit harder on Windows. There is a program called cmd, but it won't play with many of the Unix commands we will be using.
      To use them, we recommend <a href = https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> or <a href = "https://gitforwindows.org">Gitbash</a>.  
    </p>

    <h3> Basic Navigation</h3>

    <p>There are a few basic built-in commands that you need to know to navigate the command line. The most important three for navigation: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>pwd - find out where exactly you are in your directory</li>
      <li>ls - list the files available in the current directory </li>
      <li>cd - move directories. This one is a little different - you need to specifiy a path of where to go. For example, to get to file x:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>  cd x</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>


    <h2>Try it for yourself!</h2>

    <p>Hint: use the three commands above! Orient yourself, find out what paths you have, and then move.</p>
